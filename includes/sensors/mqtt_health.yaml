## MQTT health sensor examples
# These are example options — pick one that fits your install. They are intentionally
# commented or templated so they don't break config when you manage MQTT via the UI.

# Option A: command_line sensor that pings broker host (works if HA host can reach broker by ICMP)
# Requires setting `mqtt_broker` in `secrets.yaml` or editing inline host.
#
# sensor:
#   - platform: command_line
#     name: "MQTT Broker Ping"
#     command: "ping -n 1 {{ states('sensor.mqtt_broker_host') | default('192.168.1.10') }}"
#     scan_interval: 60
#     value_template: "{{ 'online' if value == 'Reply from' or 'bytes=' in value else 'offline' }}"

# MQTT Health Sensors - CONVERTED TO MODERN TEMPLATE FORMAT
# Template sensors moved to includes/templates/mqtt_health.yaml
# Converted: 1 binary sensor (mqtt_integration_present)
# Conversion completed: 2026-01-06

# Option C: If you run a broker that exposes $SYS topics, you can create an mqtt sensor
# (requires MQTT in YAML or an MQTT integration that exposes topics). Example (commented):
#
# sensor:
#   - platform: mqtt
#   topic: "$SYS/broker/uptime"
#     name: "MQTT Broker Uptime"
#     unit_of_measurement: "s"
