# 📤 SHARED_CONTEXT Folder

## Purpose
This folder contains markdown files that Jamie can **drag-and-drop** to:
- Microsoft Copilot in Edge browser (for live doc/forum searches)
- Smart Home Ops Assistant GPT chat (for logic validation and HA compatibility checks)

## How Jamie Uses This
1. Open file in VSCode or File Explorer
2. Drag file to Edge browser tab (for Edge Copilot)
3. Drag file to GPT chat window (for GPT Assistant)
4. Both AIs now have the same context

## Core Files (Always Keep Updated)

### 🎯 current_session.md
**What we're working on RIGHT NOW**  
Update this whenever work changes so Jamie can always resume.

### 📝 recent_changes.md
**Last 10 changes made to the system**  
Quick reference for "what did we just do?"

### 🚨 active_issues.md
**Open problems or todos**  
Track what needs fixing or completing.

### ✅ system_status.md
**Health check results**  
Validator outputs, service status, error counts.

## Workflow
1. ⚙️ GitHub Copilot (VSCode) maintains these files
2. 👤 Jamie drags them to other AIs when needed
3. 🧠 GPT and 💬 Edge Copilot read and respond with their expertise
4. All AIs stay synchronized
