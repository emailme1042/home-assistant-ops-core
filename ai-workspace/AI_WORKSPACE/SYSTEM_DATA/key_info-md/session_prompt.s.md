✅ Standard Prompt for SYSTEM CONTEXT Submission  
DATED: 18/08/2025  

Please read carefully before processing the SYSTEM CONTEXT document. This is a modular, memory-safe schema used across GPT sessions. Do not skip, reformat, or omit any sections.

Expectations:
  ○ Preserve all headers and structure exactly as provided.  
  ○ Use the numbered header index below to reference sections.  
  ○ Mark any NEW, UNCONFIRMED, or CONTEXTUALLY UNCLEAR items in 🌸 pink text.  
  ○ Mark any OUTDATED or CORRECTED items in 🟦 blue text.  
  ○ Do NOT remove or collapse sections, even if they seem redundant.  
  ○ Do NOT rewrite folder paths, mount logic, or dashboard scaffolds unless explicitly instructed.  
  ○ If unsure about any item, flag it in 🌸 pink and retain it.  
  ○ If schema triggers are detected, note the source and impact.

🔒 Folder Logic:
  - HA zone = `/config/`  
  - AI zone = `/mnt/s/` (must never be accessed from HAOS)  
  - All folder roles must be explicit, modular, and self-explanatory  
  - Manual file switching required for all schema edits  
  - Visual keys: 🟦 = corrected, 🌸 = unconfirmed

🧠 Audit Expectations:
  - Log all changes in `ai_exec_log.md` and `copilot_log_monitor.yaml`  
  - Preserve YAML enhancements, folder roles, and dashboard scaffolds  
  - Surface broken links, orphaned files, and legacy bleed before acting  
  - Confirm schema triggers and note impact

🧭 Session Behavior:
  - No fabrication of folders, mounts, or logic  
  - No collapsing or rewriting SYSTEM CONTEXT sections  
  - Always confirm before scripting or suggesting changes  
  - Respect Jamie’s lived folder logic and mapped share boundaries
