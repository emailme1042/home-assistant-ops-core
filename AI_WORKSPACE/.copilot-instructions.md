# 🧠 Copilot Context
You are working in a Home Assistant environment.

- Use defensive YAML (`| default(0)` and `| float`).
- Always maintain valid indentation (2 spaces).
- Assume folder structure:
  - includes/
  - dashboards/
  - templates/
  - python_scripts/
- Do not write or reference secrets.yaml.
- Prefer modular includes over inline configuration.
- Reference entities defensively (`states('sensor.x') | float(0)`).
